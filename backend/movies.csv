Piqued at her aunt's objection, Elizabeth continues to see him and he asks her to be his bride. After much pleading, she goes with him to a neighboring town where they are married. Fearing her aunt's ire, she pledges her husband to secrecy. She continues to live at home, while Hallock returns to the city, where he soon forgets his wife. Through an accident, Elizabeth meets and becomes interested in Julian Gerard, a gentleman from New York. Later, at the home of a mutual friend in New York they meet again.

In sore straits, he demands that she help him socially and financially, holding their marriage over her should she refuse. Elizabeth, unable to meet his demands for money sells her jewels. When she takes the blackmail to him, she is seen by Amanda, who is in Hallock's power. Thinking Elizabeth's relations with Hallock are the same as her own Amanda, in a fierce tirade, upbraids her for coming between them.
